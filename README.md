### How to Build

```shell
$ npm run build                 # or, `npm run build -- release`
```

By default, it builds in a *debug* mode. If you need to build in a release
mode, just add `-- release` flag. This will optimize the output bundle for
production deployment.

### How to Run

```shell
$ npm start                     # or, `npm start -- release`
```

This will start a lightweight development server with "live reload" and
synchronized browsing across multiple devices and browsers.

### How to Test

Run unit tests powered by [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with the following
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) command:

```shell
$ npm test
```

Test any javascript module by creating a `__tests__/` directory where
the file is. Name the test by appending `-test.js` to the js file.
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) will do the rest.
